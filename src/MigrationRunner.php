/**
 * Applies raw .sql migration files and records which have run.
 *
 * Hydra's migrations are plain .sql — the data-layer equivalent of its
 * hand-written repositories: no ORM, no fluent builder, just SQL. Each file in
 * the migrations directory is a forward-only change; there are no down
 * migrations by design (rollback in production is mostly fiction, and in dev you
 * re-run from scratch with {@see fresh()}).
 *
 * Files are applied in lexical order, so the timestamp prefix the
 * make:migration command writes ({Ymd_His}_name.sql) doubles as the ordering
 * key. A `migrations` table records each applied filename; a file already in
 * that table is skipped on the next run.
 *
 * This class takes the raw PDO rather than {@see Contracts\ConnectionInterface}
 * on purpose: DDL is multi-statement and unparameterised, so it runs through
 * PDO::exec — outside the prepared-statement-only seam the repositories use.
 *
 * Caveat worth knowing: MariaDB has no transactional DDL (DDL implicitly
 * commits), so a migration that fails halfway leaves partial state that cannot
 * be rolled back. Keep each migration to one logical change.
